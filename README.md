# fracture

*fracture* is an interactive audiovisual installation prompted by the accelerating rate of climate change and the contamination of water sources via fracking. This installation models virtual environments that the audience, through sensors, are able to manipulate, highlighting the agency of an individual to preserve the environment or become complicit in its destruction.
