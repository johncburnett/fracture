# fracture

*fracture* is an interactive audiovisual installation prompted by the accelerating rate of climate change and the contamination of water sourcesvia fracking. This installation will model virtual environments that the audience, through sensors, will be able to manipulate, highlighting the agency of an individual to preserve the environment or become complicit in its destruction. By making this interaction both tactile and immediate, we will expose to audience members the very real effect that they, as individuals, have in preservation.
